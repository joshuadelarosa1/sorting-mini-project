I used chat GPT for my own sort. I made very little changes, as I did not
know what else to do. My experience with chat GPT was very lovely, it gave me
some sanity. I had to give it a few different prompts in order to get what I 
actually wanted. The code otherwise was pretty easy to read, a little bit
hard to understand what was going on, but I think I get it conceptually.
